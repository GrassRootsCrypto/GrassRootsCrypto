I created two videos for people that are new to THORChain. I wanted to explain with simple pictures how it all fits together. 

### THORChain Overview
First video is a general overview regarding THORChain explaining where funds are stored and how funds are accessed within the THORChain network. This applies to THORChain regardless of which Chaosnet or Mainnet is running.

### THORNode Overview
THis is an overview of a THORNode as they do all the heavy lifting in the network - and where the magic happens.

I hope you learn something from them both.
