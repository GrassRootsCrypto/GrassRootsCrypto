I created two videos an overveiw for people that are new to THORChain. I wanted to explain with simple pictures how it all hangs together. 

### THORChain Overview
First video is a general overview regarding the THORChain explaning where funds are stored and how funds are access within the THORChain network. This applies to THORChain regardless of which chaosnet or mainnet.

### THORNode Overview
Secondly is an overview of THORNode as they do all the heavy lifting in the network - and where the magic happens.

I hope you learn something from them both.
