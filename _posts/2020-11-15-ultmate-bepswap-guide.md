Below is a video guide to the BepSwap interface. This covered how to add, swap and remove funds using a real wallet I created. 
I add funds into the BNB:Rune pool - the process is the same for any other pool. Remember there needs to be a 50%/50% split of the asset and Rune in order to add to the Liquidity Pool.
If you just add the asset, the swap is done under the hood for you.

BepSwap is a decentralised exchange where you can stake, swap and withdraw BEP2 tokens. 
BepSwap is apart of THORCHain
