This video helps people understand what Impermanent Loss is and ask hey questions when considering your exposure to Impermanent Loss. 

Impermanent Loss (IL), or in simple speak, not yet a permeant loss, it is one of the hardest concepts in Defi for most people for most people to understand.  See the video below.

### The Risk
Impermanent Loss (IL) is a risk Liquidly Providers have when staking their assets in a liquidity pool. It is the potential difference in gains between holding and being a Liquidly Provider. 

Most people seem to freak out about it because it sounds scary, hard to understand and explain.

A few things that need to pointed out here.
	1. The 'loss' is on paper only, and is not final - hence not yet permeant - it will likely change tomorrow e.g. BNB could go back to it's original price and therefore there will be no IL. It becomes permeant when you withdraw from the Liquidity Pool.
	2. If both assets rise in price by the same percentage - than it is all good - the total pool value increases. It is when it is lop sided, or the pool becomes out of balance, it is a problem.
	3. Price will always change so the amount of IL or the amount you are 'missing out' on is always changing. 
	4. The fees you get paid as a Liquidity Provider may have been more or less than what you missed out on, you need to take away any fee revenue from what you missed out on to understand your actual or net loss/gain. 

### So why do it? 

Why become a Liquidity Provider if I am exposed to the risk of Impermeant Loss?

AMM platforms like BepSwap (ThorChain) need Liquidity Providers to operate, so they make it very lucrative for Liquidity Providers by giving them a good share of the fees, offering them additional 'network benefits' and some provide additional tokens for providing liquidly, which also have value. 
It is risk many are willing to take as handsome rewards are on offer. 

It must be said, however, the more the price moves, the more IL becomes an issue, and the IL can be greater than the income generated by fees or network benefits.

Or put another way, when price movements are small, generally the income generated is more than enough to cover the Impermeant Loss but when price movements become very large, it may not be. 

Key questions to ask yourself
	1. What are you trying to achieve? e.g. hold assets in the hope they will go up - trying to somehow capitalise on every potential price increase OR provide a service and get paid for it - and not worrying too much about trying to get every potential temporary price increase.
	2. What is your time preference - are you in it for the short term or the long term? Are you interested in short trading OR long-term asset appreciation and not concerned with short term volatility?

Remembering Impermeant Loss only becomes permanent when you withdraw! 


### Summing up 

Impermanent Loss (IL) or in simple speak, not yet a permeant loss, happens during the rebalances process of the liquidity pool, which is caused by price movements. 
It is a risk Liquidly Providers have when staking their assets in a Liquidity Pool. 
The more the price moves (e.g. the more the liquidity pool becomes out of balance), the more IL becomes an issue. 
AMM platforms need Liquidity Providers to operate, so some may give benefits/rewards to Liquidity providers (particularly when they are new).

I don't know your situation or what is best for you, whatever you decide to do, I hope you have a better understanding of IL.
