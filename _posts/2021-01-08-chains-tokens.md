This video is for people who are getting started in the Alt coin space. It explains some of the differet Blockchains, Token Standards and gives some examples of tokens. 

This is important to understand, as there is a difference between ERC-20 token and a BEP-2 token. Getting them confused at the wrong time, could cost you your funds!
