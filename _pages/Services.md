GrassRoots Crypto is a company dedicated to education to new users in the crypto space. I understand how difficult it can be to find what you need to know, even with the power of Google. It can be very frustrating trying to sort through the noise to get to the facts!

If you are new to the crypto space, it can be hard to get to make sense of it all. There is so much to lean, it is hard to know where to start. To learn Blockchain/Crypto, you have to learn many things such as IT and Finance. 

Maybe you are looking to learn more about cryptocurrencies, looking to know where to buy, looking to self-custody or looking to understand Defi and Yeld Farming – not matter what you are looking to do, GrassRoots Crypto is here to provide you the information you need to move on with your learning journey. 
About the only thing I can’t do is provide investment advice and specific tax information :)

## GrassRoots Crypto can assist you with:
- Bitcoin and Ethereum understanding
- Blockchain Strategy
- Defi – Liquidity Pools / Impermanent Loss
- Smart Contract Development
- Trading – Exchanges, CEX and DEX
- How to earn interest on your coins.
- Self custody and cold storage
- Running your own node

Just reach out and ask!
