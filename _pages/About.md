## Education, Training, Consulting, Advice, Defi

GrassRoots Crypto is a company dedicated to education to users in the crypto space. I understand how difficult it can be to find what you need to know, even with the power of google. 

If you are new to the crypto space, it can be hard to get to make sense of it all. There is so much to lean, it is hard to know where to start.

All sessions are by bookings only, please contact us via email to enquire about bookings.
GrassRoots Crypto is located in Darwin and works with Blockchain Darwin to run weekly Blockchain/Crypto meet ups. In this modern world, training and consulting can happen in any location - just ask.

## About Me

GrassRoots Crypto was started to educate new users to the world of blockchain / Crypto. I understand the challenge / frustration new people go through trying to lean and understand. There is so much information out there, it is hard to know where to start.

I have been in the blockchain Crypto space for over 2 years increasing my knowledge via books, paid courses, pod casts, group chats and talking to other likeminded people. 

I have helped many people understand and get into crypto over the last 12 months and currently I create videos for the THORChain community explaining beginner and advanced concepts. 

I am here to give you the information you need to know to make the best decisions for yourself.
