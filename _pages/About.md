## Education, Training, Consulting, Advice
GrassRoots Crypto is a company dedicated to education to users in the crypto space. I understand how difficult it can be to find what you need to know, even with the power of google. 

If you are new to the crypto space, it can be hard to get to make sense of it all. There is so much to lean, it is hard to know where to start. 

GrassRoots Crypto aims to explain what you need to know using common relatable examples. Check out my video series avaliable on Youtube.

GrassRoots Crypto was started to educate new users to the world of Blockchain / Crypto. I understand the challenge / frustration new people go through trying to lean and understand. There is so much information out there, it is hard to know where to start. I found the videos I watched used a lot of the jarken I am use to but new people didn't understand. I wanted to do something different. 

I am here to give you the information you need to know to make the best decisions for yourself.


### How I started

Having a IT background I had been interested in working in the Crypto space. I had very good understand of Bitcoin, played in the Ethereum Defi space using UniSwap, Compound, mStable and Balancer and keeped any eye on the industry. 

I started by testing THORChain's BepSwap interface during testnet then decided to run a testnode for myself - just to lean had have some fun. 

I started my youtube channel after the THORChain community had requested an instrucitonal video series on THORNodes, so I created the THORNode Instructional video series for current and new THORNode operators. 

After leaning much more about THORChain, I decided to create more videos on THORChain which then evolved into explaining basic Defi concepts like Liquidity Pools for newer people. 

This along with helping helped many new people understand and start their journey into crypto over the last 12 months has given me the purpose that is GrassRoots Crypto.
